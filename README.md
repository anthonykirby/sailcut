## Building

This is a Qt app and the build system relies on `qmake`, which comes with Qt distributions. You can install Qt from:

- macOS: `brew install qt`
- Windows: download an [official release](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/online_installers/qt-unified-windows-x86-online.exe) (LGPLv3 license)
- Linux: install Qt5 development tools, e.g. Fedora `dnf install qt5-devel` (then for Fedora, run `qmake-qt5` instead of `qmake`)

From the root of the repo, run:

```
qmake
```

This will prepare a `Makefile`, which can be used to make the binaries for the app. This is done by simply running:

```
make
```

Which will make the following runnable apps:

- macOS: `bin/Sailcut CAD.app`
- Windows: `bin/sailcut.exe`
- Linux: `bin/sailcut`

And that's it!
